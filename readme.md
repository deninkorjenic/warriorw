There are 2 sections, admin and standard use.

Admin user can't access user section and user can't access admin section.



# Admin Section #
Admin section is used to create new quizes, trainings, educations, tasks, weeks and programs.

You start with creating weeks, each week should have a name that will be presented to use, usualy this should go like `Week 1`, `Week 2`, etc. but you are free to name it how ever you wish.

### NOTE ###
Be careful when you create weeks, you must set week number in correct order how you want to display weeks and related stuff to users.

When you have at least one week you can create other stuff for it, educations, tasks, etc.

When you have enough weeks you can create and publish program, go to `/programs`m there you should check weeks you want to place in program and click __Create Pogram__

### NOTE ###
Please be careful when you select weeks, you should select weeks in order you want them to be displayed to user.
Let's say you made a week and you want it to be fifth week in users program but you selected it second when creating program, it will be user's second and not fifth week.
